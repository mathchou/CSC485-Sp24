Additionally, I work two jobs, and although I balance my financial obligations with my academic commitments, I would appreciate some flexibility on deadlines. However, I am usually good about keeping them. I am highly interested in Data Science and look forward to learning more and having the flexibility to do projects I find interesting throughout the semester!
