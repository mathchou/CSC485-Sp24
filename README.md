Dear CSC485,

This repository will serve as a central place for distribution and submission of work.

You will upload your weekly TODO lists and reports here in a folder titled <lastname_firstname>.

I've included an example TODO list/report as TODO_template.txt

If you have questions about Git, do what all good programmers do and google it. If that doesn't help, send me an email.

Best,
Professor Chou
