Goals for this week:
- [x] Brainstorming project
- [ ] Search for other HR data sets with similar variables
- [ ] Clean and format "Company" dataset

### Last Week's Goals:

- [x] Do exploratory data analysis
- [x] Figure out how to pull request in Git
- [x] upload slides from MTH320 project

#### Reflections:
This week I feel as if I was able to get a better grasp on how to ise Git. After completing the brainstorming Project, I can now start to format and search for other data sets. After Tuesday's class I believe that the early stage of this will involve a lot of searching for data and cleaning it early on. On Tuesday, I found another data set that has data on several variables similar to IBM HR dataset including termination dates.
