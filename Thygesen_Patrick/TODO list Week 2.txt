Goals for this week:
- [x] Do exploratory data analysis
- [X] Figure out how to pull request in Git
- [x] upload slides from MTH320 project

### Last Week's Goals:

- [X] Upload folder to Git
- [x] Complete introduction
- [ ] Upload photo to Git

#### Reflections:
I was able to complete the introduction form that Dr. Chou uploaded. 
I uploaded a photo to Git but it was under my personal branch and not the main branch. This week I hope to address this issue and make sure I can complete a pull request properly.
