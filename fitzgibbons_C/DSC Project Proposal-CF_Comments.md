Hi Colin,

I think your proposed projects sound great.

Some things to think about:

1. It's only top 50 per country. Is there that big a discrepancy between a song being top 10 and being top 20? You might somehow fudge the actual rank prediction to not be as fine. Maybe break it into "huge hits" and "hits" by listen-count or something. If you are trying to predict exact rank, I would expect there to be a lot of error.

2. It might be worth grouping countries by primary languages spoken. I'm not sure if that affects the song list dramatically or not.

3. Try to do a time-series analysis using week by week data (if all the past versions of the data set are available). What keeps songs in the top 50 for longer, etc.

Bridge project sounds great too, if maybe a bit broad in scope. I think focus first on what factors affect time to complete vs. projected time. You could break it down by state as well, to see which states are more on top of their repairs.
